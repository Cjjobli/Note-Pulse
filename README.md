Ever wanted to learn musical notes?

(Optimized for PC/laptop use; the mobile interface wasn’t a focus during development.)

Playing the piano is one of my favourite hobbies! Unfortunately I don't have perfect pitch so I must memorize the note through repetition and practice. Which is why I developed this project initially for myself to improve my note-reading skills, and now I’m excited to share it with everyone!

This is the first version of my project, and while I’ve learned so much more since its creation, I’m looking forward to revisiting it and improving it in the future (I definitely had too much fun with the CSS, but I also want to rework this in the future).

Key features of this project:
- Multiple difficulty levels for both treble and bass clefs, featuring progressively challenging note selections.
- An intuitive UI with dynamic elements such as score tracking, timers, and helpful guides for user engagement.
- Real-time feedback with audio cues for correct and incorrect answers, reinforcing learning.
- Dynamic content loading, game state management, and input validation, all powered by JavaScript.
- Demonstrated expertise in DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating seamless user experiences.

Planned improvements and future ideas:
- Support for sharp and flat notes.
- User score saving for tracking progress over time.
- Login functionality for personalized experiences.
- More customization options for learners.
- Mobile interface
